I took a conceptual approach to a view through a window. It’s kind of like a window into my heart. My inspiration for my code is falling in love, in my case with the city of Vienna. The baroque architecture, clean mountain water and public transport system warmed my heart. The golden frames are adaptationsed from the organ inside Stephansdom, representing a window frame. Through the frames, the viewer gazes upon a glass heart, a reference to the glass of a window. 

The code begins with orchestral vocals of DJ Victor Borges’ edit of ‘Unlock It’ and the viewer ‘holding’ a key. If the viewer ‘unlocks’ the frame by clicking the keyhole, the frames drift apart and the key disappears. I was concerned whether this is intuitive for the viewer. However, the lyrics of the song: “unlock it… got the key, can you unlock it?”  should provide a hint.

The glass heart is also interactive: it fades to dark blue and lights up if the viewer moves to the centre. A ‘view’ is ephemeral. I wanted to capture that, like brief and sweet love affairs, the memories of locations are idealised, sparkly and fade over time. 

I want this piece to have a dreamlike quality that evokes a sense of wanderlust. I would like the code to feel magic.
